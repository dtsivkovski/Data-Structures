How to run:
- Compile in the docker container using: `g++ *.cpp`
- Run the code using `./a.out inputFile outputFile`
    - The argument `inputFile` should be replaced with the name of the inputFile where your english sentence is stored
    - The argument `outputFile` should be replaced with the name of the HTML file (which will be created if it doesn't exist) for the translation to be output to.
